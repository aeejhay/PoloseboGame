📌 Overview
The Palosebo Voice Game is a browser-based mini-game inspired by the traditional Filipino festival game Palosebo, where participants climb a greased bamboo pole to capture a flag at the top. This modern reimagining brings the cultural classic to life through voice control — players shout or make noise to help the character climb.

🧠 Concept & Gameplay
Players control a character climbing a tall bamboo pole by using their voice. The louder they shout, the faster the character climbs. The goal is to reach the red flag at the top — just like in real Palosebo! The game uses the Web Speech API to detect input, offering a fun, engaging, and hands-free experience.

🎨 Design
The visual style is bright and playful, with Filipino barrio-inspired elements:

Bamboo pole and red flag – the main goal of the game

Festive background – blue skies, green hills, traditional huts, and colorful pennant flags to reflect a fiesta vibe

Cartoon character – a determined boy climbing with every shout

🔊 Voice Interaction
By integrating the Web Speech API, this game explores how traditional mechanics can be translated into new forms of interaction — creating a fun, noisy, and nostalgic twist.
